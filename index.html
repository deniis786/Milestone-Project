                        <h3>Step 1: Equipment</h3>
                        <p>In addition to the wine ingredients, home winemaking shouldn't be expensive, so it's not
                            necessary to splurge on special equipment. You will need the following supplies:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                a 2 gallon (7.6 L) crock or glass jar
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                a 1 gallon (3.8 L) carboy
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                a thin plastic tube to be used for siphoning
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                clean wine bottles with corks or screw caps
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                campden tablets
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You will also want to wash up used wine bottles, invest in a couple of new corks and a corker if
                            you plan on bottling any wine. Another note, the process is pictured in a glass pitcher in order
                            to show what your results will look like but you will actually need to use a crock, listed
                            above, rather than a pitcher.

                        <h3>Step 2: Preparation</h3>
                        <p>Wine can be made with any type of fruit, though grapes and berries are the most popular choices.
                            Choose fruit at the peak of its flavor. It's best to choose organic fruit that hasn't been
                            treated with chemicals, since you don't want these to end up in your wine. If possible, use
                            fruit you've picked yourself or buy some from a farmer's market. Take off the stems and leaves,
                            and make sure the fruit doesn't have particles of dirt or grit. Rinse the fruit thoroughly and
                            place it in your crock. Using a clean potato masher or your hands, crush and squeeze the fruit
                            to release its juices. Keep doing so until the level of the fruit juice is within 1 1‚ÅÑ2 inches
                            (3.8 cm) of the top of the crock. Cover the crock and store overnight. The day after you make
                            the mixture, uncover it and stir it thoroughly, and recover.

                        <h3>Step 3: Fermenting the wine</h3>
                        <p>When the bubbling slows down, about 3 days after it begins, it's time to strain out the solids
                            and siphon the liquid into your carboy for longer-term storage. Once you've siphoned it into the
                            carboy, affix the airlock to the opening to allow for the release of gas while preventing oxygen
                            from coming in and spoiling your wine. If you don't have an airlock, you can use a small balloon
                            placed over the opening with about 5 pin sized holes in it. It's better if you can let it age
                            for up to nine, during which time the wine will age and mellow, resulting in a much improved
                            taste.To prevent the wine from catching a bacteria that could cause it to turn to vinegar, add a
                            Campden tablet to the mixture as soon as you remove the airlock. Siphon the wine into your clean
                            bottles, filling them almost to the top, and cork them immediately.
